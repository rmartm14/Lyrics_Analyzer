When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be

Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be

Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Yeah there will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be


Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on til tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be

Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be, The Beatles
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
Im not half the man I used to be
Theres a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I dont know she wouldnt say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know I dont know


Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how, The Beatles
