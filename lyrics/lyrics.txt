When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
Youre so fuckin special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
I dont care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
Oh oh
Shes running out the door
Shes running out
She run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
I dont belong here,Radiohead
Karma police arrest this man
He talks in maths he buzzes like a fridge
Hes like a detuned radio
Karma police arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
Karma police Ive given all I can
Its not enough Ive given all I can
But were still on the payroll
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us

I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself,Radiohead
A heart thats full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that wont heal
You look so tired unhappy
Bring down the government
They dont they dont speak for us
Ill take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please,Radiohead
Ive been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
SpiderMans control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I dont see myself upon that list
But she said where dyou wanna go
How much you wanna risk
Im not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Doodoodoo doo doo
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Oh I want something just like this
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Doodoodoo doo doo
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Ive been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But Im not the kind of person that it fits
She said where dyou wanna go
How much you wanna risk
Im not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Oh I want something just like this
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Doodoodoo doo doo
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Oh I want something just like this
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Doodoodoo doo doo
Doodoodoo doodoodoo
Where dyou wanna go
How much you wanna risk
Im not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh I want something just like this
Oh I want something just like this

Come up to meet you tell you Im sorry
You dont know how lovely you are
I had to find you tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh lets go back to the start
Running in circles coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
Its such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh its such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
Im going back to the start
Ohooh oohoohoohooh
Ahooh oohoohoohooh
Ohooh oohoohoohooh
Ohooh oohoohoohooh,Coldplay
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
Once youd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ohohwoah ohoh oh
Ohohwoah ohoh oh
Ohohwoah ohoh oh
Ohohwoah ohoh oh
 I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 Be my mirror my sword and shield
 My missionaries in a foreign field
 For some reason I cant explain
 I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm,Coldplay
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
Theyll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
Another promise another scene
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
Youd see that we should never be afraid to die
Rise up and take the power back
Its time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their times coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
Hey hey hey hey,Muse
Im trapped and my backs up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
Im grinding it out no one can see
The pressures growing exponentially
Im trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
Im hitting the ground and Im sprinting
Im falling behind now Im tuning out
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building
Dont push me 
Dont push me 
Let me get off the ground 
To you Im no longer bound 
Dont stop me 
Dont choke me 
I need you out of my head 
Youve got me close to the edge 
Im feeling the pressure
I cant break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face out of my mind
I see your corruption
Im not blind
Ill carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building
Dont push me 
Dont push me 
Let me get off the ground 
To you Im no longer bound 
Dont curb me 
Dont thwart me 
I need you out of my head 
Youve got me close to the edge 
Pressure building
Pressure building
Dont push me 
Dont push me 
Let me get off the ground 
To you Im no longer bound 
Dont stop me 
Dont block me 
I need you out of my head 
Youve got me close to the edge 
Pressure building
Pressure building,Muse
Help me Ive fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game I tried to infiltrate but now Im losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy can someone rescue me
Absent gods and silent tyranny
Were going under hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy can someone rescue me
Show me mercy
Show me mercy please
Help me Ive fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy can someone rescue me,Muse
