When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Yeah there will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on til tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be,The Beatles

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know I dont know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe and how,The Beatles
Twas a dark day in Dallas November 63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was aridin high
Good day to be livin and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said Wait a minute boys you know who I am
Of course we do we know who you are
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts weve come to collect
Were gonna kill you with hatred without any respect
Well mock you and shock you and well grin in your face
Weve already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly so quick by surprise
Right there in front of everyones eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed skillfully done
Wolfman oh Wolfman oh Wolfman howl
Rubadubdub its a murder most foul
Hush little children youll understand
The Beatles are comin theyre gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister go get your coat
Ferry cross the Mersey and go for the throat
Theres three bums comin all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
Im goin to Woodstock its the Aquarian Age
Then Ill go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window let the good times roll
Theres a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks pour the cement
Dont say Dallas dont love you Mr President
Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district like a cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When youre down on Deep Ellum put your money in your shoe
Dont ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead money to burn
Dealey Plaza make a lefthand turn
Im going down to the crossroads gonna flag a ride
The place where faith hope and charity died
Shoot him while he runs boy shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye Charlie goodbye Uncle Sam
Frankly Miss Scarlett I dont give a damn
What is the truth and where did it go
Ask Oswald and Ruby they oughta know
Shut your mouth said a wise old owl
Business is business and its a murder most foul
Tommy can you hear me Im the Acid Queen
Im riding in a long black Lincoln limousine
Ridin in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
Im leaning to the left I got my head in her lap
Oh Lord Ive been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter and no quarter do we give
Were right down the street from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years theyve been searchin for that
Freedom oh freedom freedom over me
I hate to tell you mister but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up little Susie lets go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River lets keep hope alive
Turn the radio on dont touch the dials
Parkland Hospital only six more miles
You got me dizzy Miss Lizzy you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
Im just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
Ive blood in my eye got blood in my ear
Im never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruders film Ive seen that before
Seen it thirtythree times maybe more
Its vile and deceitful its cruel and its mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him someone said to me Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun
Air Force One comin in through the gate
Johnson sworn in at 238
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
It is what it is and its murder most foul
Whats new pussycat Whatd I say
I said the soul of a nation been torn away
And its beginning to go into a slow decay
And that its thirtysix hours past Judgment Day

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before theyre forever banned
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the wind
Yes and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea
Yes and how many years can some people exist
Before theyre allowed to be free
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesnt see
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the wind
Yes and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes and how many deaths will it take til he knows
That too many people have died
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the wind,Bob Dylan
Come gather round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon youll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone
For the times they are achangin
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance wont come again
And dont speak too soon for the wheels still in spin
And theres no tellin who that its namin
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are achangin
Come senators congressmen please heed the call
Dont stand in the doorway dont block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are achangin
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And dont criticize what you cant understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you cant lend your hand
For the times they are achangin
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are achangin,Bob Dylan
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
Theres too much confusion
I cant get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I weve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl,Bob Dylan
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you
People call say Beware doll youre bound to fall
You thought they were all akiddin you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw youve gone to the finest school all right Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobodys ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now youre gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
Hes not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say Do you want to make a deal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it aint no good
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Aint it hard when you discover that
He really wasnt where its at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Theyre all drinkin thinkin that they got it made
Exchangin all precious gifts
But youd better take your diamond ring ya better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls ya ya cant refuse
When ya aint got nothin you got nothin to lose
Youre invisible now ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
Aw how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone,Bob Dylan
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
For I cant help falling in love with you,Elvis Presley
The warden threw a party in the county jail

Shifty Henry said to Bugs For Heavens sake

Yowyowyow
Huh huh huh
Please allow me to introduce myself
Im a man of wealth and taste
Ive been around for a long long year
Stole many a mans soul and faith
I was round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game
I stuck around St Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank held a generals rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name oh yeah
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game ah yeah
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out Who killed the Kennedys
Well after all it was you and me

And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer
Cause Im in need of some restraint
So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your welllearned politesse
Or Ill lay your soul to waste mm yeah
Pleased to meet you hope you guessed my name mm yeah

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and theyre all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door I must have it painted black
Maybe then Ill fade away and not have to face the facts
Its not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see your face painted black
Black as night black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted painted painted painted black
Yeah,The Rolling Stones

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I cant let you slide through my hands
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
Wild wild horses couldnt drag me away
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
Wild wild horses couldnt drag me away
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I dont have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Lets do some living after we die
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
Wild wild horses well ride them some day
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
Wild wild horses well ride them some day,The Rolling Stones
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B Goode
His mother told him Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B Goode Tonight
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Oh go go Johnny go
Oh go go Johnny go
Go Johnny B Goode,Chuck Berry
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work the little money comin worked out well
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hifi phono boy
Did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a soupedup jitney was a cherry red 53
And drove it down Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell,Chuck Berry
When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
And then mother took me to Grammar School
But I stopped all in the vestibule
Every time that bell would ring
Catched me playin with my ding a ling
Once I was climbing the garden wall
I slipped and had a terrible fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But held on to my ding a ling
Once I was swimming cross Turtle creek
Many snappers all around my feet
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing
With both hands holdin my ding a ling
This here song it aint so sad
The cutest little song you ever had
Those of you who will not sing
You must be playin with your own ding a ling
My ding a ling Your ding a ling your ding a ling
We saw you playin with your ding a ling
My ding a ling everybody sing
I want to play with my ding a ling,Chuck Berry
Out of all the reindeers you know youre the mastermind
Run run Rudolph Randalph aint too far behind

Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph Im reeling like a merrygoround,Chuck Berry
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started doing the things you used to do
As I was motorvatin over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac arollin on the open road
Nothin will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin bout ninetyfive
Shes bumper to bumper rollin side by side
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
Youve started back doing the things you used to do
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldnt do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin lane
The rain water blowin all under my hood
I knew that was doin my motor good
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
The motor cooled down the heat went down
And thats when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac asittin like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin like its sittin still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do,Chuck Berry
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
Theres too much confusion
I cant get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
Hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But uh but you and I weve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin falsely now
The hours getting late
Hey
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower,Jimi Hendrix
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things they dont seem the same
Acting funny but I dont know why
Scuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Dont know if Im coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery
Whatever it is that girl put a spell on me
Help me Help me
Ah no no
Yeah Purple haze all in my eyes
Dont know if its day or night
You got me blowing blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time
No help me
No yeah purple haze
Oh no no
Oh help me
Tell me tell me
Cant go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No no no
No no purple haze,Jimi Hendrix
Well shes walking through the clouds
With a circus mind thats running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
Anda fairytales
Thats all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When Im sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
Its alright she said its alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything anything
Fly on little wing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah little wing,Jimi Hendrix
Hey Joe where you going with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe I said where you going with that gun in your hand

Aint no hangman going to
He aint gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now I got to go now
Hey Joe you better run on down
Goodbye everybody ow
Hey Joe run on down,Jimi Hendrix
Anger he smiles towering
In shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown
Sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the lifegiving waters
Taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies
Lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on
But theyre all bold as love
Yeah theyre all bold as love
Yeah theyre all bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact Im trying to say its frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine
Keeps holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But Im uh yeah lm bold as love
Yeah yeah well Im bold bold as love
Hear me talking girl
Im bold as love
Just ask the axis
He knows everything
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah,Jimi Hendrix
This is a mans world
This is a mans world
But it wouldnt be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl
You see man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark
This is a mans mans mans world
But it wouldnt be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl
Man think about a little bit of baby girls
And a baby boys
Man makes them happy
Cause man makes them toys
And after man make everything everything he can
Even though the man makes money
To buy from other man
This is a mans world
But it wouldnt be nothing nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl
Oh how how man needs a woman
I sympathize with the man that dont have a woman
Hes lost in the wilderness
Hes lost in bitterness
Hes lost in loneliness,James Brown

Uh With your bad self
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Some people say weve got a lot of malice
Some say its a lot of nerve
But I say we wont quit moving until we get what we deserve
We have been buked and we have been scorned
Weve been treated bad talked about as sure as youre born
But just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair ha
Brother we cant quit until we get our share
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
I worked on jobs with my feet and my hands
But all the work I did was for the other man
Now we demand a chance to do things for ourselves
Were tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Oohwee give it to me
All right youre out of sight
All night so tough
Youre tough and rough
Oohwee uh youre killing me
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
We demand a chance to do things for ourselves
Were tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else
Were people we like the birds and the bees
Wed rather die on our feet
Than be living on our knees
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
All right now good God
You know we can do the boogaloo
Now we can say with the funky talk and we do
Sometimes we sing and we talk
You know we jump back and do the camel walk
All right now all right
All right
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
Say it loud Im black and Im proud
We demand a chance to do things for ourselves
Were tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else
Were people we like the birds and the bees
Wed rather die on our feet

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And youre the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didnt know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now Im no longer doubtful of what Im living for
And if I make you happy I dont need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh baby what youve done to me 
You made me feel so good inside 
And I just wanna be 
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman,Aretha Franklin

That you ever had
Kiss me once again

Cause I aint never

Aint never had a man hurt me so bad no
Well this is what Im going to do about it

Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Its useless to say
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since weve been apart
Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Its useless to say
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
 Those happy hours
 That we once knew
 Though long ago
 They still make me blue
 They say that time
 Heals a broken heart
 Time has stood still
 Since weve been apart
I said Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Sing the song to me
Its useless to say
So Ill just live my life of dreams of yesterdays,Ray Charles

Wouldnt it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldnt have to wait so long
And wouldnt it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldnt it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together weve been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Oh wouldnt it be nice
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldnt be a single thing we couldnt do
Oh we could be married 
And then wed be happy 
Oh wouldnt it be nice
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Oh wouldnt it be nice
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby,The Beach Boys

Theres a lady whos sure all that glitters is gold
And shes buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh ooh and shes buying a stairway to Heaven
Theres a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook theres a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh makes me wonder
Ooh makes me wonder
Theres a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh it makes me wonder
Ooh really makes me wonder
And its whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
Ohohohohwoahhh
If theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now
Its just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
Theres still time to change the road youre on
And it makes me wonder
Ohh woah
Your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know
The pipers calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And shes buying a stairway to Heaven,Led Zeppelin
Ahh Ahh
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde sing and cry
Valhalla I am coming
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ahh Ahh
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now youd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing,Led Zeppelin
Oh let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooh baby I been flying
No yeah mama there aint no denying
Oh ooh yeah Ive been flying
Mama mama aint no denying no denying
Oh all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find trying to find where Ive been
Oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My ShangriLa beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin through Kashmir
Oh father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooooh
Oh when Im on when Im on my way yeah
When I see when I see the way you stayyeah
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah when Im down
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah but Im down so down
Ooh my baby ooh my baby let me take you there
OhCome on oh let me take you therelet me take you there
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah let me take you therelet me take you there,Led Zeppelin

As around the sun the earth knows shes revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows loves the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That Ill be loving you always
As now cant reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That Ill be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That Ill be loving you always
As today I know Im living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustnt fear
For Ill know deep in my mind
The love of me Ive left behind
Cause Ill be loving you always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away 
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through 
Until the day that you are me and I am you 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
We all know sometimes lifes hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say youre in it but not of it
Youre not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our childrens grandchildren
And their greatgreat grandchildren will tell
Ill be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away 
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 
Until the day that is the day that are no more 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through 
Until the day that you are me and I am you 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dreamUm 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away 
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4

Until the day that you are me and I am you,Stevie Wonder
Very superstitious
Writings on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladders about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past
When you believe in things
That you dont understand
Then you suffer
Superstition aint the way
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You dont want to save me
Sad is my song
When you believe in things
That you dont understand
Then you suffer
Superstition aint the way
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devils on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past
When you believe in things
That you dont understand
Then you suffer
Superstition aint the way
No no no,Stevie Wonder
Isnt she lovely
Isnt she wonderful
Isnt she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love wed be
Making one as lovely as she
But isnt she lovely made from love
Isnt she pretty
Truly the angels best
Boy Im so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I cant believe what God has done
Through us hes given life to one
But isnt she lovely made from love
Isnt she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
Thats so very lovely made from love,Stevie Wonder
No New Years Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring no song to sing
In fact heres just another ordinary day
No April rain no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summers high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart,Stevie Wonder
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Dont make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just wont quit
But here are some of musics pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For theres Basie Miller Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ellas ringing out
Theres no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all all allallall over people
Cant you feel it all over
Come on lets feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody all over people,Stevie Wonder
I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh and just like the river Ive been runnin
Ever since
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will
Its been too hard livin
But Im afraid to die
Cause I dont know whats up there
Beyond the sky
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will

And I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin me dont hang around

A long time comin but I know

Lor there been time that I thought
I couldnt last for long
But now I think Im able to
Carry on
Its been a long
Along time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will,Sam Cooke

Dont know much about history
Dont know much biology
Dont know much about a science book
Dont know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
Dont know much about geography
Dont know much trigonometry
Dont know much about algebra
Dont know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be
Now I dont claim to be an A student
But Im trying to be
For maybe by being an A student baby
I can win your love for me
Dont know much about history
Dont know much biology
Dont know much about a science book
Dont know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
La ta ta ta ta ta ta 
Hmmmmmm 
Whoa la ta ta ta ta ta ta 
Hmmmmmm 
Yeah but I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be,Sam Cooke
This Little Light of Mine is a traditional gospel song written by Harry Dixon Loes and first collected by musicologist John Lomax in 1939,Sam Cooke
Its summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddys rich and your mamas good looking
Hush little baby
Dont you cry
Hmmmm
One of these mornings youre gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by
Hmmmm,Sam Cooke
