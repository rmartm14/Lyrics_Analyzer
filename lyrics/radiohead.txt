[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here,Radiohead,Creep [Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
[Verse 2]
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself,Radiohead,Karma Police [Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Let me out of here),Radiohead,No Surprises
