Gimme one of those
To help me through
I've got a problem
I cannot speak
Into 
Walked a thousand miles
With your heart
Where it’s supposed to
Never hide
Where I'm going
I walked and I timed
Since there's nothing wrong
To be good
To be good
I’m to 
So when it gets dark
Make your mark
On my face
I walked away
Wants to offend, radiohead
